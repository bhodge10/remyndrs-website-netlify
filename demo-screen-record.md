## Recording Tips

- **Use a real phone** texting the actual Remyndrs number — authenticity matters more than polish
- **Start with the phone lock screen**, then open the message to show it's a real text thread
- **Keep each reel to 10-15 seconds** — Instagram Reels under 15 seconds perform best
- **Add a 0.5-second flash** at the end showing "$0 to start — no credit card"
- **End every video** with the CTA: **Text Hello to (855) 552-1950**
