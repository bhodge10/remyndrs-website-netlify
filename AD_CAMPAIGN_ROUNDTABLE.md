## Phase 1: Strategic Foundation

### Session 1: Campaign Objectives & Positioning

**Sarah (CMO) opens:**
> Our primary goal is user acquisition — specifically, getting people to text START to our number and begin their 14-day free trial. We're not selling a $8.99 subscription cold. We're selling a free trial that requires zero commitment — no app download, no credit card, no account creation. Just one text message. That's our funnel: see ad → text START → experience the product → convert to paid. The friction is absurdly low, and our ads need to communicate that.

**Marcus (Launch Specialist):**
> That zero-friction entry point is your superpower. Most subscription products have to overcome download resistance, account creation fatigue, and credit card anxiety. You have none of that. Your CTA is literally "send a text." That's the easiest conversion action in all of consumer marketing. Our entire campaign should be engineered around making people feel like they'd be stupid NOT to try it. The risk is zero. The reward is never forgetting anything again.

**Vanessa (Social Media Specialist):**
> Agreed. But we need to be platform-specific about how we deliver that message. Reddit users will see through anything that feels like a traditional ad — we need to lead with value and social proof. Facebook skews older and more emotional — we lead with relatable life problems. Instagram is visual-first — we need scroll-stopping creative that demonstrates the product in action. Same core message, three different executions. Let me also flag: the fact that this works on ANY phone — even flip phones — is a Facebook goldmine. That demographic is on Facebook.

---

### Session 2: Audience Targeting Strategy

**Vanessa (Social Media Specialist):**
> Let me break down our targeting approach per platform:

#### Reddit Targeting

| Audience Segment | Subreddits / Interest Targeting | Ad Format |
|---|---|---|
| ADHD community | r/ADHD, r/adhdmemes, r/ADHDers, r/executivefunction | Promoted posts (text-first) |
| Productivity seekers | r/productivity, r/getdisciplined, r/Notion, r/todoist | Promoted posts |
| Parents | r/Parenting, r/Mommit, r/daddit, r/beyondthebump | Promoted posts |
| Life hacks / simplicity | r/lifehacks, r/simpleliving, r/LifeProTips | Promoted posts |
| Tech-curious seniors | r/AskOldPeople, r/retirement | Promoted posts |

**Key Reddit insight:** Reddit users respect authenticity. Our ads should feel like a real user sharing a discovery, not a corporation selling a product. Testimonial-driven creative with real quotes from Chris W. (ADHD) and Joey (alarm comparison) will outperform polished brand ads 3-to-1 on this platform.

#### Facebook Targeting

| Audience Segment | Targeting Parameters | Ad Format |
|---|---|---|
| Parents 28-45 | Interests: parenting, family, kids activities + behavior: engaged shoppers | Carousel, Video, Single image |
| Professionals 30-55 | Job titles: manager, owner, director + interests: productivity | Single image, Video |
| Seniors / Caregivers 50-70 | Interests: senior care, health, family + age targeting | Single image, Carousel |
| ADHD-aware 20-40 | Interests: ADHD, mental health, neurodivergent + behavior: mobile-heavy | Video, Single image |

**Key Facebook insight:** Facebook's algorithm rewards engagement. Our ads need to provoke a "tag someone who needs this" or "OMG this is me" reaction. Problem-first headlines that hit an emotional nerve, then present Remyndrs as the effortless solution.

#### Instagram Targeting

| Audience Segment | Targeting Parameters | Ad Format |
|---|---|---|
| Millennial parents | Interests: mom life, parenting hacks, family planning | Reels, Stories, Carousel |
| Young professionals | Interests: productivity, self-improvement, career growth | Reels, Stories |
| ADHD/neurodivergent | Interests: ADHD awareness, mental health, brain hacks | Reels, Stories |
| Wellness-oriented | Interests: mindfulness, self-care, life organization | Carousel, Stories |

**Key Instagram insight:** Instagram is all about the first 1-2 seconds. We need a visual hook — ideally a phone screen showing a real Remyndrs text conversation. The "aha moment" happens when people see how natural the interaction is. Reels under 15 seconds will be our highest performers.

**Marcus (Launch Specialist):**
> I want to add a launch sequencing layer to this. We shouldn't turn on all three platforms simultaneously. Here's my recommended rollout:

#### Launch Sequence

| Week | Platform | Objective | Budget Allocation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Week 1-2** | Reddit only | Seed authentic conversations, test messaging, build early social proof | 30% of budget |
| **Week 3-4** | Reddit + Facebook | Scale what works from Reddit, launch Facebook with proven messaging | 50% of budget |
| **Week 5+** | All three platforms | Add Instagram with polished creative informed by Reddit/Facebook learnings | 100% of budget |

> Reddit first because it gives us the fastest, most honest feedback. If our messaging doesn't resonate on Reddit, we'll know within 48 hours and can iterate before spending real money on Meta. Reddit comments are basically free focus groups.

**Sarah (CMO):**
> I like the phased approach. Our budget isn't unlimited, and I'd rather spend $500 learning on Reddit than $5,000 learning on Facebook. Let's talk specific ad creative now.

---

## Phase 2: Ad Creative Development

### Session 3: Reddit Ad Campaign

**Vanessa (Social Media Specialist):**
> Reddit ads need to feel native. Promoted posts that look like organic content outperform display-style ads by 5x on this platform. I'm proposing 5 ad variants, each targeting a different persona/subreddit cluster.

---

#### Reddit Ad 1: "The ADHD Discovery" (r/ADHD, r/adhdmemes)

**Format:** Promoted text post with image

**Headline:**
`I finally found a reminder system that works with my ADHD brain, not against it`

**Body copy:**
`I've tried every productivity app — Todoist, Notion, Apple Reminders, Google Keep. They all require too many steps. Open the app, find the right screen, type it in, set the time. By then I've forgotten what I wanted to remember.`

`Last month a friend told me about Remyndrs. It's not an app. You literally just text what you want to remember — like "remind me to move the laundry in 30 minutes" — and it texts you back when it's time. That's it.`

`No app to forget to open. No interface to learn. Just texting, which I'm already doing constantly anyway.`

`I've been using it for 3 weeks and my therapist actually noticed I've been more on top of things. 14-day free trial, no credit card. You just text START to (855) 552-1950.`

`Not sponsored, just genuinely impressed by how low-friction it is.`

**Image:** Screenshot of a real Remyndrs text conversation showing a messy, casual reminder ("remind me to call dr chen tmrw at 2 also pick up meds") and Remyndrs understanding it perfectly.

**CTA:** `Text START to (855) 552-1950`

---

#### Reddit Ad 2: "The Parent Chaos" (r/Parenting, r/Mommit, r/daddit)

**Format:** Promoted text post

**Headline:**
`My wife asked how I suddenly remember everything. It's a texting service and it costs less than a latte.`

**Body copy:**
`I used to be the dad who forgot picture day, showed up to soccer with the wrong kid's cleats, and missed prescription refills.`

`Now I just text things to Remyndrs when I think of them — "remind me about Emma's picture day Friday" or "add pull-ups to the grocery list." It texts me back at the right time. No app. No notifications to ignore. Just texts.`

`It works on any phone (my mother-in-law uses it on her flip phone for medication reminders). 14-day free trial, no credit card required. Text START to (855) 552-1950.`

`Seriously, the bar for trying this is literally sending one text message.`

**CTA:** `Text START to (855) 552-1950`

---

#### Reddit Ad 3: "The Productivity Hack" (r/productivity, r/getdisciplined)

**Format:** Promoted text post

**Headline:**
`The most underrated productivity tool I've found doesn't even have an app`

**Body copy:**
`Hot take: the reason most reminder/task apps fail isn't the features — it's the friction. You have to remember to open the app, which defeats the purpose of a reminder system.`

`Remyndrs is just SMS. You text "remind me to follow up with the client about the proposal Friday at 9am" and it handles the rest. Natural language, no formatting required. It even handles recurring reminders — "remind me about team standup every weekday at 8:45am."`

`It also stores info — I texted "remember the WiFi password at the office is Guest2024" and three weeks later asked "what's the office WiFi?" and got it back instantly.`

`$8.99/month after a 14-day free trial (no credit card). Text START to (855) 552-1950.`

**CTA:** `Text START to (855) 552-1950`

---

#### Reddit Ad 4: "The Simple Solution" (r/AskOldPeople, r/simpleliving, r/lifehacks)

**Format:** Promoted text post

**Headline:**
`Set up my 70-year-old dad with a text-based reminder service. He uses it more than I do.`

**Body copy:**
`My dad takes 4 medications at different times of day and was constantly mixing them up. I tried setting up phone alarms but he'd dismiss them and forget what they were for.`

`Found Remyndrs — it's a service where you just text what you want to remember and it texts you back at the right time. No app to download. No account to create. Works on any phone including his old flip phone.`

`He texted "remind me to take the blue pill at 8am every day" and now he gets a text every morning that says exactly what to take. He also saved his pharmacy number and WiFi password as "memories" he can ask about anytime.`

`Free 14-day trial, no credit card. Text START to (855) 552-1950. If your parent can send a text message, they can use this.`

**CTA:** `Text START to (855) 552-1950`

---

#### Reddit Ad 5: "The Business Use Case" (r/smallbusiness, r/Entrepreneur)

**Format:** Promoted text post

**Headline:**
`I replaced my $30/month CRM follow-up reminders with a $9/month texting service`

**Body copy:**
`I run a landscaping company with a crew of 8. I don't need Salesforce. I need something that reminds me to call back the Johnson estimate on Monday at 8am and remembers that Crew B is assigned to the Oak Street site.`

`Remyndrs is just text messaging. I text what I need to remember, and it texts me at the right time. I've saved client details, job site notes, and set recurring reminders for weekly crew check-ins. All from my phone's native messaging app.`

`$8.99/month. No app to install, no training, no IT department needed. My guys on the crew could use it too if they wanted.`

`14-day free trial, no credit card. Text START to (855) 552-1950.`

**CTA:** `Text START to (855) 552-1950`

---

### Session 4: Facebook Ad Campaign

---

### Session 5: Instagram Ad Campaign

**Vanessa (Social Media Specialist):**
> Instagram is visual-first, thumb-stop creative. We need to show the product in action — real phone screens, real text conversations. Reels and Stories will be our highest performers. Carousel for the more considered audiences.

---

## Phase 3: Prospect Feedback

### Session 6: Showing the Campaigns to Prospective Customers

**Context:** All 4 prospective customers were shown the complete Reddit, Facebook, and Instagram ad campaigns above. Each was asked to evaluate from their own perspective: Would this ad stop their scroll? Would they take the action? What would they change?

---

#### Priya Sharma (34, Project Manager / Mom) — Reviews All Platforms

**On the Reddit "Parent Chaos" ad:**
> This would absolutely stop me scrolling in r/Parenting. The line "showed up to soccer with the wrong kid's cleats" — I literally did that last month. The tone is perfect for Reddit. It doesn't feel like an ad, it feels like a dad sharing a win. My one critique: the phrase "costs less than a latte" in the headline is overused in marketing. Everyone says that. Replace it with something specific — "costs less than one forgotten prescription copay" or just drop the price comparison entirely from the headline and let the free trial do the work.

**On the Facebook "Mom/Dad" carousel:**
> The carousel is strong. The progression from chaos to solution to relief is exactly the emotional journey I'd go through. Card 1 with "Mom, it's PICTURE DAY tomorrow" made my stomach drop — that's how real it is. But I think you need a Card 0 before the current Card 1. Start with a simple text question: "When was the last time you forgot something important?" That primes the emotional response before you show the scenario. Also, the "Learn More" CTA button should be "Try for Free" — I'm more likely to tap that.

**On the Instagram "Text Demo" Reel:**
> This is the one that would actually make me try it. Seeing the phone screen, the natural text, and the response — that's the proof I need. Fifteen seconds is the right length. My suggestion: add a half-second flash showing the price — "$0 to start, no credit card" — because my immediate question after seeing something cool on Instagram is "how much?" If that's not answered instantly, I keep scrolling.

**Would she try Remyndrs based on these ads?**
> Yes. The Facebook carousel or the Instagram Reel would get me. I'd text START right from the ad if I could tap the phone number. Actually — can you make the phone number tappable in the ad? On mobile, that would be huge.

---

#### Damon Brooks (26, Freelancer, ADHD) — Reviews All Platforms

**On the Reddit "ADHD Discovery" ad:**
> This is easily the best ad in the entire campaign. It reads like a genuine post I'd find on r/ADHD. The journey — "I've tried every app, they all have too many steps, this one is just texting" — is exactly the thought process someone with ADHD goes through. The therapist line from Chris W. is devastating in the best way. That's not a feature — that's a life outcome. I would upvote this even if I knew it was an ad. Two notes: (1) "Not sponsored, just genuinely impressed" at the end is a nice touch but Reddit will see through it since it's a promoted post. Drop that line. (2) Add the monthly price somewhere in the body. Reddit hates feeling tricked into clicking something and then discovering a cost.

**On the Facebook ads:**
> I barely use Facebook, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. But the "Forgetting Problem" ad with the checklist — that's solid. The "raise your hand if you've ever" format is proven engagement bait on Facebook. I'd add "set a reminder and then forgot what the reminder was for" to the list — that's the ADHD experience in one sentence, and it'll get massive engagement from people tagging friends.

**On the Instagram "Scroll-Stopper List" Reel:**
> This is the one that would catch me. The rapid-fire texts showing different use cases — lists, reminders, memory storage, retrieval — all in 10 seconds? That demonstrates the entire product without saying a word about features. It's just... showing it working. That's how you sell to my generation. Don't tell me what it does, show me. One improvement: make the typing animation look real — like someone actually thumb-typing, with slight pauses and maybe a typo that Remyndrs still understands. That would be the ultimate ADHD flex: "I can text like a mess and it still works."

**Would he try Remyndrs based on these ads?**
> The Reddit ad alone would do it. I'd text START before I finished reading the comments. The Instagram Reel is my second choice. Zero friction to try something is literally the only way to sell to someone with ADHD — and you've nailed that.

---

#### Connie Wallace (61, Retired, Caregiver) — Reviews All Platforms

**On the Facebook "Senior/Caregiver" ad:**
> This one speaks directly to me. "Your kids will worry less. You'll feel more in control" — that's the emotional core of caregiving. I worry about my mother every single day. If she could text "remind me to take my medicine at 9am every day" and actually get that reminder, that would take a weight off both of us. The image concept is right — show someone my age, not a model, looking comfortable with their phone. The "even flip phones" mention is important — my mother has one. That's a selling point, not a footnote. Make it bigger.

**On the Reddit ads:**
> I don't use Reddit, so these wouldn't reach me. But my son does — and the "Set up my 70-year-old dad" ad (Reddit Ad 4) is something he would absolutely send me. That's actually a powerful insight: the person who sees the ad isn't always the person who uses the product. Caregivers and adult children are the discovery channel for the older generation. Your Reddit and Instagram ads should target the 30-45 year-old who will then set up their parent. Include a line like "Send this to someone who could use it" or "Set up a parent in 60 seconds."

**On the Instagram Stories:**
> The Before/After Stories are clear and I could follow them even though I'm not a big Instagram user. But the "chaotic" aesthetic on Panel 1 might be off-putting for older users. Instead of chaotic, make it relatable — show an actual cluttered kitchen counter with sticky notes, or a fridge door covered in reminders. That's my life. Then show the phone as the replacement. Physical mess → digital simplicity. That visual metaphor is stronger than abstract "chaos."

**Would she try Remyndrs based on these ads?**
> The Facebook ad would get me. I'd show it to my daughter first and we'd set it up together for my mother, then I'd start using it for my own reminders too. The free trial with no credit card is essential — I would NOT enter payment information based on a Facebook ad. Not a chance.

#### Javier Morales (41, Business Owner) — Reviews All Platforms

**On the Reddit "Business Use Case" ad:**
> "I replaced my $30/month CRM follow-up reminders with a $9/month texting service" — that headline would stop me. Business owners are always looking for ways to cut costs without cutting capability. The body copy about the landscaping company is relatable (I run a plumbing business, similar deal). But I'd want to know: can I search my saved information? If I text "remember Johnson Electric owes us $4,200 for the March job," can I later text "what does Johnson Electric owe?" and get that back? If yes, that needs to be in the ad. That's a killer business feature that's buried.

**On the Facebook "Forgetting Problem" ad:**
> This would work on me, but through a personal lens, not a business one. I'd see it on Facebook while scrolling at home, relate to the "forgot a bill payment" line, and try it for personal use. Then once I see how it works, I'd start using it for business. That's actually the natural adoption path for small business owners — personal first, business second. Don't try to sell me a "business tool" on Facebook. Sell me a "life tool" and I'll figure out the business application myself.

**On the Instagram carousel:**
> The "Real People, Real Texts" carousel is well-structured. I like that it shows different use cases on each slide without overwhelming. But Slide 5 — the CTA — needs to be stronger. "No catch" sounds defensive, like you're anticipating skepticism. Instead, end with a bold guarantee: "If you don't love it in 14 days, you paid nothing and we delete everything." That's confidence. That makes me trust you.

**Would he try Remyndrs based on these ads?**
> The Reddit business ad would get me to try it. The Facebook ad would get me to try it through a different door. Either way, the zero-commitment trial is what closes the deal. I've been burned by subscriptions that are hard to cancel. "Text STOP to unsubscribe" — put that in every ad. Business owners need to know the exit is easy.

**Vanessa (Social Media Specialist):**
> Now let me lay out the budget framework and KPIs:

### Recommended Budget Allocation (Monthly)

| Platform | % of Budget | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Facebook | 45% | Broadest reach, strongest for parents and seniors/caregivers |
| Instagram | 30% | Best for visual product demos, reaches millennials and Gen Z |
| Reddit | 25% | Highest engagement quality, best for ADHD and productivity audiences |

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Cost per START text (CPA) | < $3.00 | Track unique START texts per ad set via UTM or unique keyword |
| Click-through rate (CTR) | > 1.5% (Facebook/IG), > 0.8% (Reddit) | Platform analytics |
| Trial-to-paid conversion | > 15% | Backend tracking (14-day cohort) |
| Cost per paid subscriber | < $25.00 | CPA / conversion rate |
| Engagement rate | > 3% (comments, shares, saves) | Platform analytics |
| Ad frequency cap | < 3x per user per week | Platform settings |

### A/B Testing Plan

| Test | Variant A | Variant B | Run Time |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Reddit headline tone | Casual/personal story | Direct benefit statement | 2 weeks |
| Facebook CTA button | "Try for Free" | "Send Message" | 2 weeks |
| Instagram Reel length | 10 seconds | 15 seconds | 2 weeks |
| Testimonial vs. demo | Quote-led creative | Product demo creative | 2 weeks |
| Price mention timing | Price in headline | Price only in body/description | 2 weeks |

**Sarah (CMO):**
> Let me also share our brand guidelines for these ads:

### Brand Voice Guidelines for Ads

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Sound like a friend sharing a recommendation | Sound like a corporation selling a product |
| Lead with the problem, then reveal the solution | Lead with features or pricing |
| Use "text" and "text message" (never "SMS") | Use technical jargon or acronyms |
| Show real text conversations as proof | Use stock mockups or fake conversations |
| Emphasize zero friction: "just text" | Oversell or use urgency tactics ("LIMITED TIME!") |
| Mention "no app" early — it's our #1 differentiator | Compare directly to competitors by name |
| Let the free trial close the deal | Push for immediate paid conversion |

## Phase 5: Final Prospect Reactions to Revised Campaign

### Session 8: Final Review After Incorporating Changes

**Context:** The 4 prospects were shown the revised ads with all high-impact changes incorporated.

---

**Priya (Project Manager / Mom):**
> Much better. Removing the "latte" comparison and replacing the CTA with "Try for Free" was the right call. The tappable phone number is huge — I tested it mentally and I can see myself tapping it right from my Instagram feed. The added "$0 to start" flash in the Reel answers my price question instantly. One last thought: for the Facebook carousel, you should test a version where Card 1 is just a text message screenshot with no explanation. Let the conversation speak for itself. People are trained to read text message screenshots — it's native to how we consume content now.

**Damon (Freelancer, ADHD):**
> The Reddit ADHD ad without the "not sponsored" line is cleaner. Adding the price in the body was the right move — transparency is everything on Reddit. The Instagram Reel with the typo that Remyndrs still understands? That's going to go viral in ADHD spaces. People will share it not as an ad, but as a "look at this" moment. That's the dream scenario for any brand. I genuinely believe the Reddit ADHD ad and the Instagram typo Reel will be your two highest-performing pieces of creative across the entire campaign.

**Connie (Retired, Caregiver):**
> The "Send this to someone who could use it" line is a smart addition. That's exactly how I'd discover this — my daughter would send it to me. The sticky notes visual replacing the abstract chaos in the Instagram Stories is much more relatable. I can see my fridge right now with 8 sticky notes on it. One more thing I thought of: for the Facebook senior ad, add a line about the daily summary feature. "Every morning you'll get a text listing everything on your plate for the day." For someone my age managing medications and appointments, that single feature is worth the entire subscription.

**Javier (Business Owner):**
> The confidence guarantee — "If you don't love it, you paid nothing and we delete everything" — is much stronger than "no catch." I'd trust that. The "Text STOP anytime" addition is also good. As a business owner, the exit clause is as important as the entry. The memory retrieval demo in the business ad is a game-changer. "What does Johnson Electric owe?" → "$4,200 for the March job" — that turns this from a reminder service into a pocket database. Lead with that in the business-targeted creative. That's the feature that justifies $8.99/month for a business owner.

## Final Notes from the Specialists

**Vanessa (Social Media Specialist):**
> The single most important thing about this campaign is the CTA simplicity. Every ad ends with "Text START to (855) 552-1950." That's it. No landing page, no form, no app store redirect. The conversion action IS the product experience. That's the rarest thing in advertising — the first interaction with the ad IS the first interaction with the product. Protect that simplicity at all costs.

**Marcus (Launch Specialist):**
> Launch sequencing matters more than launch creative. Start small on Reddit, learn fast, then scale to Meta with proven messaging. The biggest mistake I see brands make is launching everywhere simultaneously with untested creative and burning 60% of their budget learning lessons they could have learned for 10% on one platform. Reddit is your testing lab. Facebook is your scale engine. Instagram is your brand builder.

**Sarah (CMO):**
> Our product sells itself once people try it. The entire purpose of this ad campaign is to get one text message sent. Every word, every image, every CTA should be optimized for that single action: text START. Nothing else matters until they're in the trial. The product will do the rest.
