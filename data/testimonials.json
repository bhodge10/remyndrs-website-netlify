      "quote": "Remyndrs is an incredible text service. Prior to Remyndrs, I was putting reminders in Outlook, creating lists in Notes, and putting reminders in my Calendar app. The Remyndrs text service consolidates all 3 into 1. I often failed to check emails and calendar entries timely however I never miss a Remyndrs text. \n\nThe Remyndrs text service is extremely easy to use. I text ‘create a grocery list’ one is created. I text ‘add sugar and yogurt to my grocery list’ and it’s done. I text ‘show my grocery list’, all items on that I’ve added are there. I recently tried a new nail polish color at the salon. I text ‘remember that I like smokey rose polish number 151’ and it’s saved for me to retrieve the next time I’m at the salon. I am so forgetful. Remyndrs solves this problem for me. I text ‘remind me tomorrow to call the doctor at 9, email Bob about the new position at 11, and pick up Sally at 3’, all reminders are set. I get a summary of reminders in the morning, also I get a reminder at the time for each task when it’s due.  \n"

      "quote": "I've been using Remyndrs and honestly… it's one of those services you don't realize you need until you have it. Being able to simply text things I want to remember and know they'll come back to me at the right time is a game changer. It feels effortless and smart, like having a personal assistant in your pocket. For a brand-new service, Remyndrs is already incredibly useful, and I've started relying on it daily. If you're someone who juggles a lot (or just hates forgetting things), this is absolutely worth trying!"

      "quote": "When I first heard about this service I thought I won't use it. I figured that I can set an alarm to remind me or I could have Alexa set an alarm. Only to have the alarm go off and forget what I set it for. I absolutely love this texting service. I can send a text to Remyndrs and a week later Remyndrs sends me a text reminding me of what the alarm is for."

      "quote": "I work 12-hour shifts and my schedule rotates. Setting reminders in a calendar app never worked because my days off change every week. With Remyndrs I just text what I need and when, and it handles the rest. Medication reminders, bill due dates, even reminding me to call my mom on my days off. It's become essential."

Now I use it for my medications, doctor appointments, and even saved my WiFi password as a memory. No apps to learn, no accounts to manage. My daughter worries less and I feel more in control."
