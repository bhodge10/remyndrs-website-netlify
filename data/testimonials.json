Now I just text my reminders and it's done. Grocery lists, appointments, even remembering my favorite nail polish color\u2014it's all in one place. So simple, and I actually use it."

      "quote": "I've been using Remyndrs and honestly\u2026 it's one of those services you don't realize you need until you have it. Being able to simply text things I want to remember and know they'll come back to me at the right time is a game changer. It feels effortless and smart, like having a personal assistant in your pocket. For a brand-new service, Remyndrs is already incredibly useful, and I've started relying on it daily. If you're someone who juggles a lot (or just hates forgetting things), this is absolutely worth trying!"

      "quote": "When I first heard about this app I thought I won't use it. I figured that I can set an alarm to remind me or I could have Alexa set an alarm. Only to have the alarm go off and forget what I set it for. I absolutely love this texting service. I can send a text to Remyndrs and a week later Remyndrs sends me a text reminding me of what the alarm is for."
